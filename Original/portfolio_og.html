						<b>Sbeaty Code: </b><a href="homePage.html"><em>Homepage</em></a> 
					</p></br>
					<p>
						This website, Sbeatycode, was completely hand-coded by scratch. I didn’t use any templates or frameworks (such as Bootstrap) to make it. This website is mobile responsive. I had an older version of 
						this website up, but I decided to make a better version. This site uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a little JQuery. You can find more details about my site at the blog, as well as information about any new updates.

							<b>Vehicle Log: </b><a href="/vehicle_log/login.php"><em>Link</em></a>
						</p></br>
							This project was made for Greenville Technical College's CPT 283 PHP Programming 1 class. It was made using PHP, HTML, CSS, and utilizes Bootstrap. The whole project was made within
							a virtual Linux environment within a campus server. The database uses phpMyAdmin. The goal was to make an inventory management Web App for managing different user's vehicles, and information
							about those vehicle's. Specifically, it’s used to track details such as maintenance done, what type of tires a vehicle uses, how much mileage the vehicle has, and things of that nature. There 
							are two types of user accounts. Standard user accounts are able to manage and maintain the information about their own, personal vehicles. Admin accounts are able to look at any information any 
							user has inputted, add new vehicles, and edit details. In this way, in can be used either by a family, or by a small business. This project was made in about 12 weeks, while I was learning PHP.
							This was my first time attempting a project of this scope.

						<b>Book Inn:</b><br/>
						This project was made for Greenville Technical College's CPT 275 Senior Project. It was made using ASP.NET, HTML, CSS, utilizes Bootstrap, and was made within Visual Studio. The database used Azure.
						This was a team project, consisting of myself and four other students. The goal was to make a Web App that a bookstore for a small/medium sized college could use to keep track of book orders for classes,
						reorder books, modify existing orders, and have different user roles. Student accounts are ‘read only’, and are able to see which classes use which books. Teacher accounts are able to order books, and change 
						their existing orders. Bookstore Managers are able to do anything a Teacher can, except they can order books for any class. Admin accounts can order, change, and delete any order. Admin approval is needed whenever
						an order is made, in order to prevent duplicate orders by Teachers and Managers. This project was made in the span of about 12 weeks. Unfortunately, due to situations out of my control, I can’t provide a link to a
						working version of this project.
