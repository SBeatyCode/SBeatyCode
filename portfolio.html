						 This project was built using PHP (mysqli syntax), HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. The project is a content management system for a blog, similar in style to wordpress. Users can make accounts, and comment on posts. Admins can see and modify any user, post, comment, or post category information, as well as create new ones and delete existing ones. 
                        <br><br>
                        SIGN IN: Use Username: Admin and Password: Admin to look at and try out the Admin section. I recommend you create your own user account as well. Since the email system isn’t turned on*, I recommend you don’t use your real email address when you sign up.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>*PLEASE NOTE:</b> While the Contact and Lost Password systems both work, I currently have to keep email-sending off for my webhost.

						A Splatoon fansite. This webpage was made as practice, and as an attempt to mimic the kinds of sites that Nintendo (and others) make to advertise their products. My focus for this wegpage was making it ‘look’ fun, and tastefully using some JQuery and CSS animations. Under the Links section is a link back to my site.

						 The idea was to make a website for a fictional spa resort using the Bootstrap framework, and making it so that it would be easy to use with Wordpress. The site is fully responsive, and I learned a lot about organizing code and making one’s code more readable to others, as well as documenting one’s code.

                         It was made using PHP, HTML, CSS, and utilizes Bootstrap. The whole project was made within
				        a virtual Linux environment within a campus server. The database uses phpMyAdmin. The goal was to make an inventory management Web App for managing different user's vehicles, and information
				        about those vehicle's. Specifically, it’s used to track details such as maintenance done, what type of tires a vehicle uses, how much mileage the vehicle has, and things of that nature. There 
                        are two types of user accounts. Standard user accounts are able to manage and maintain the information about their own, personal vehicles. Admin accounts are able to look at any information any 
                        user has inputted, add new vehicles, and edit details. In this way, in can be used either by a family, or by a small business. This project was made in about 12 weeks, while I was learning PHP.
                        This was my first time attempting a project of this scope.
