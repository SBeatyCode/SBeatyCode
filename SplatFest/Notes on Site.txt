Have a container with the navbar static on top - MAYBE add a fith button that's just the logo

Start with the cover art as a parallax scrolling image (possibly procede this with the 2 color squids 
if you need the space so it'll scroll right) then go into the squids BG. 

Have the Inklings fadein and fly into place w/ JS.

Have each of the buttons be a quick link to parts of the webpage (top, bottom, ect)
Make the buttons ANIMATED! Have them bounce, slant, ect

Maybe have the other Inklings fly in at another point, see how it looks.

Maybe have another parallax effect at the bottom with the game cover-art again, with a footer with
copyright info.
