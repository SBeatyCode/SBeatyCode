						One of the big initial choices I had to make when I was building the site, in terms of style, was what method I wanted to use in order to give the page an appealing,
						clean look. I knew going into it that I wanted to avoid manually placing everything for every single page, because that would take a lot of extra time. Placing floats,
						determining the width for each individual element and trying to make each page look consistent within that isn’t impossible, but I wanted to avoid it.
					</p>
					<p>
						Initially, I was thinking about using a Flexbox-Model. This would theoretically solve the responsiveness question, and would keep all the elements organized. When I 
						tried it though by making a mock-up of my blog page, I didn’t like the way all the elements looked when the page was scaled down. Things were too crowded, and it was harder to place
						items specifically within the page. So, I tried a style I had recently learned while working on a page for a friend – the Grid-View.  
					</p>
					<p>
						With the Grid-View, each container or div is given a value, from 1-12, that determines the size it takes up - with the idea being that 12 would take up an entire row. So essentially, 
						what you’re doing is laying out ‘rows’ of elements on the page. If you wanted to have 2 elements side by side in a row, you would use 6 and 6 (unless you wanted different sizes, then you 
						could do 7 and 5, ect). What’s also cool about this, is that you can have one section off to the side, and keep placing elements/containers alongside it. For example, in a lot of my pages
						I have a “placeholder” div with a value of 2 – which exists alongside all the other rows. Then next to that placeholder, I place elements and sections like normal. As long as I remember 
						the placeholder of 2, I can place rows of elements with total values of 10 next to this placeholder section. This gives the page a built-in left-margin, and centers the page.  
					</p>
					<p>
						The Grid-View also helps a lot with responsiveness, that’s discussed more in the CSS and Responsiveness blog post.
