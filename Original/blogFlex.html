				<h4><em>Updates:</em></h4></br>
					<p>
						I'm currently putting together my new website. This blog is initially hard-coded into the pages,
						but soon I'll change it so that new posts are pulled from a database instead, and give myself the ability
						to edit and create new posts. 
					</p></br>
				<h4><em>About:</em></h4></br>
					<p>
						My name is Stephen Beaty. I created, coded and maintain Sbeatycode. This blog serves as a 
						compliment to my website. Here, I'll be blogging about things I'm working on, things I've made,
						things I've learned WHILE working on things, and so forth. I hope that this blog will be useful to
						others like myself.
					</p></br>
					<p>
						This blog will most likely largely discuss Web Development, Java, C# .NET and Unity, and Java. However,
						I'd also like to learn Linux, Python, C++ and possibly other things, so stay tuned! 
					</p>

					<h3 class="article1Intro">Welcome to my blog! A quick introduction.</h3>
					<p class="articleDate">- Stephen Beaty - 4/7/17</p>
					<p class="articleBody">
						Recently I've been doing a lot of studying and practicing with Web Development. That's largely why I decided to
						completly redesign my website. I also want to keep adding features to it, as well as creating some sample
						"mock up" sites and pages that show off what i can do, but would be incongruous with my main site.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<div id="article2">
					<h3 class="article2Intro">Another Article</h3>
					<p class="articleDate">- Stephen Beaty - 1/11/11</p>
					<p class="articleBody">
						Here is another article. Isn't it cool? Awww yeah, baby cakes. Don't forget to add a pagination to the bottom
						of the screen, right above the footer. ALSO the site isn't fully responsive yet, don't forget to finish that!
						The About and Updates sections should be like title bars on the top in mobile-mode and then like, you click/tap
						to expand them out to read them. Like drop-down menus. Because having them UNDER the blog or OVER it would look
						kinda tacky and gross?
					</p>
				</div>
				
				
				<div id="article3">
				</div>
				<h3 class="article3Intro">A note to myself</h3>
				<p class="articleDate">- A date -</p>
				<p class="articleBody">
					Ideally, I would like a way I could edit these, have the newest articles automatically post, get the date, ect.
					I should be able to do that with Javascript/SQL. I'll need to look into that. ALSO for the sidebar, see if you can
					make a script so that the length doesn't go past the length of the page and/or the length of the article section.
					Or alternatively, once the article section grows larger, you can just make it 'stick' to the side of the screen.
					Or, you can keep the article section the same size it is now, but then like just have a 'full article' page
					for each blog post you write. That's kinda 'bleh' though. Maybe just have it so that once an article is
					X-length, then you 'hide' part of it and have a button or anchor to 'Show Full' and 'Minimize' the article.
					So idk. See what makes sense. This is like it's
					whole own separate project WITHIN your website, it's cool.
