# SBeatyCode
The code for my website, SBeatyCode

This is all the code for my website. This includes the website, and all of the projects and portfolio peices that I have on SBeatyCode.

This will mainly serve as version control for myself as I add new project, make changes, and so forth. But it's also so other people
can see what I've worked on.

I hope that if you're reading this, you find what I've done helpful or useful in some way, and I would appreciate any feedback!
